# Hourly-JS 📅
## You Days, scheduled!

## Description
This dynamic scheduler features multi day, hour by hour planning - allowing you to plan in advance and view previous days' tasks. Hourly-JS also allows you to view and add tasks using a custom date and time range. All your scheduled tasks are stored in local storage so it's persistent when you refresh the page and your schedule is private, only you can see it! 👀🔐

The motivation behind creating Hourly-JS was that it became difficult to plan my day efficiently and stick to the day-plan so, I created a solution. My solution was to develop a custom web app which would allow me to keep track of my tasks hour-by-hour, day-by-day... That's when Hourly-JS was born!
